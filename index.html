        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
      <p>I am a freshman undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.bju.edu">Bob Jones University</a> studying Biblical Counseling.
         I am from Westminster, Maryland originally, but I now live in Greenville, South Carolina.
         When I am not in college I work at a restaurant. I love spending time with my family and friends. I love going to the beach for vacations.
                                            
         </p>
         <p>
            When I am on campus, I focus on my studies. My relationship with God is the most important thing to me. 
            I love exploring in downtown Greenville, and making new adventures. My hobbies are roller skating, reading, and singing.

         <p>
            I like to spend time with my society. When I am home, I love spending time with my puppies. My sisters are my best friends.
            I played soccer for my society on my first semester of college. We made it to the playoffs, and
            won the championships. I like to work out and go on jogs when I can. I love making new friends and making new adventures.
